# BioServer-N2

The micro server of visable light face recognition.

## Introduction
The BioServer-N2 mini-server can be used as back-end server for facial recognition devices under small scale applica-tion. BioServer-N2 receives video streams from front-end cameras or captured photo streams, then perform 1:N face comparison, and reports or synchronizes the results to access control, time & attendance or surveillance system for further usage. With strong performance and directional optimization of the server-level facial recognition algorithm, the speed of facial recognition can easily reach 20 faces per second.
